# AAmoghh Borehole Analyzer 🏗️🔍

**Smart. Systematic. Soil Intelligence.**

**AAmoghh Borehole Analyzer** is a research-driven, intelligent geotechnical tool built to simplify and standardize borelog interpretation using advanced statistical, clustering, and codal methods.

This repository provides a **public demo version** of the interface and selected outputs for **educational and non-commercial use only**.  
⚠️ **Core analytical modules remain proprietary under a custom non-commercial license.**

## 🚀 Features – Demo Version

- 📂 Upload and preview borelog data (CSV format)
- 📊 Depth-wise plots (SPT, Cu, φ)
- 📚 Auto-layer summary (KMeans / thresholds)
- 🧠 Interpreted soil profile visualization
- 📄 Sample report structure and layout

> ⚠️ **Note:** This version does not include proprietary ML/statistical logic.  
It demonstrates the user interface and documentation structure only.
